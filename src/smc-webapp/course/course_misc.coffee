# This function is absolutely absurd...
# Expects a trimmed and lower-cased search and immutable list of assignments
# Does NOT sort the assignments.
# To sort, pass the list to a sorter..
# Expects :
#     list     : iterable with filter (js array or immutable.List satisfy this)
#     search   : String
# list objects must fit the schema, member : type
#     search_key : string
# Returns
# list        : list
# num_omitted : number
